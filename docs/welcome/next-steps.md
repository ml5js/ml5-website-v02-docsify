# Next Steps

If you reach this page, we assume you have successfully installed ml5.js and built your first ml5 projects following our [Getting Started](https://ml5js.github.io/ml5-website-v02-docsify/#/) page! Here are some next steps to help you continue your ml5 journey.

> #### Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning with ml5.js 👉[ Learn](https://youtu.be/26uABexmOX4?si=nqPoD6bQrVTU-YFw) _By Daniel Shiffman_
>
> This playlist provides an introduction to developing creative coding projects with machine learning. The theory and application of machine learning algorithms is demonstrated in JavaScript using the p5.js and ml5.js libraries.

> #### The Nature of Code - Chapter 10. Neural Networks & Chapter 11. Neuroevolution 👉[ Learn](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/) _By Daniel Shiffman_
>
> In chapter 10, "we’ll begin with a conceptual overview of the properties and features of neural networks and build the simplest possible example of one (a network that consists of a single neuron). Afterwards, we’ll examine strategies for creating a “Brain” object that can be inserted into our Vehicle class and used to determine steering. Finally, we’ll also look at techniques for visualizing and animating a network of neurons."
> In chapter 11, "the path forward passes through the field of neuroevolution, a style of machine learning that combines the genetic algorithms from Chapter 9 with the neural networks from Chapter 10. A neuroevolutionary system uses Darwinian principles to evolve the weights (and in some cases, the structure itself) of a neural network over generations of trial-and-error learning. In this chapter, I’ll demonstrate how to use neuroevolution with a familiar example from the world of gaming. I’ll then finish off with some variations on Craig Reynolds’s steering behaviors from Chapter 5, where the behaviors are learned through neuroevolution."
