Welcome to the ml5.js reference page! Here you can browse the various categories of functionality that ml5.js provides. We have categorized the functionality of ml5.js based on whether you want to customize the model and train with your own data.

We currently have 3 categories:

- **ml5 Model**:
  - The _ml5 Model_ provides ready-to-use models that you directly feed inputs (image, video, audio, text, etc.) and get outputs (labels and confidence scores).
- **ml5 + Teachable Machine**:
  - The _ml5 + Teachable Machine_ allows you to create models with your own input (images, sound, and poses) using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) in a fast, easy and accessible way, and import the trained models to ml5.
- **Train your own model!**
  - The _Train your own model!_ allows you to build and train your own machine learning models with your own data right using ml5 library.

See the sidebar for more information.
