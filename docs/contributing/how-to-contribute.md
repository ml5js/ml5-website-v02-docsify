Our community is always looking for enthusiasts to help in all different ways.

- · **Develop**. [GitHub](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library) is the main place where code is collected, issues are documented, and discussions about code are had. Check out the [contributing documentation to get started](/contributing/develop-contributor-notes.md) with developing the library.
- · **Document**. Everyone loves documentation. Help is needed porting examples, and adding documentation, and creating tutorials.
- · **Teach**. Teach a workshop, a class, a friend, a collaborator! Tag [@ml5js on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ml5js?lang=en) and we will do our best to share what you're doing.
