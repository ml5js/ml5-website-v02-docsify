Our community is always looking for enthusiasts to help in all different ways.

- **Development**. [GitHub](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library) is the main place where code is collected, issues are documented, and discussions about code are had. Check out the [Contributor Notes](/contributing/develop-contributor-notes.md) to get started with developing the ml5js library and website.

- **Documentation**. Quality documentation is crucial for the usability of our library. You can help by writing, updating, or translating documentation to ensure it's accessible to all users. We are also open for examples, demos, and tutorials that guide users through the features of each model. Refer to the [Contributor Notes](/contributing/documentation-contributor-notes.md) for more information.

- **Glossary**. We aim to maintain a glossary of terms to help users understand key concepts and terminology related to machine learning and ml5js. This glossary is designed to be editable by any ml5 user. Add new terms or update existing ones by submitting the [ml5 Glossary Contribution Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJo6XU1-D1rDkuUIKSs7wx6svpZtw6p9vBPHdQvKPxpq-ERA/viewform?usp=pp_url)!

- **Community Share**. You are encouraged to share your projects, tutorials, ideas, and stories within the ml5 community! You can submit via the [Community Contribution Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPz0ICzTSVdLAteIKwJ-zFzX6dX5l3dOpjWGzm6LIZutKvlA/viewform), tag [@ml5js on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ml5js?lang=en), or share in our [Discord forum](https://discord.gg/sUtHWmgg)!
