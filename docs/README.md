# Getting Started

Welcome to the ml5.js documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to get up and started with ml5.

## Create an Empty Project

First, we need to create an empty project to start with. Here, we introduces two ways to initialize your project:
### Try Ml5.js Online
If you would like to get a taste of ml5.js in minutes, the easiest way is using the [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/), you can open the web editor and find [the next step to import ml5 library](/?id=try-ml5js-online-1).

*<img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__bulb.png" alt="tip icon" aria-hidden="true"> If you are not familiar with p5.js, check out the [p5.js Get Started page](https://p5js.org/get-started/) to know more!*

### Try Ml5.js Locally
If you want to start a project from scratch and develop it locally, have something set up as follows.

> + <img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__memo.png" alt="text editor icon" aria-hidden="true"> A text editor (e.g. [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublimetext](https://www.sublimetext.com/))
> + <img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__computer.png" alt="browser icon" aria-hidden="true"> Your web browser: Chrome & Firefox preferred

Your project directory should look something like this:

```
|_ /my-first-ml5-project
  |_ index.html
  |_ sketch.js
```

**Where**:

* <img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__open_file_folder.png" alt="folder icon" aria-hidden="true">**my-first-ml5-project/**: is the root project folder
  * &ensp; <img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__spiral_note_pad.png" alt="file icon" aria-hidden="true">**index.html**: is an .html file that has your html markup and library references
  * &ensp; <img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__spiral_note_pad.png" alt="file icon" aria-hidden="true">**sketch.js**: is where you'll be writing your javascript

If you are done, find [the next step to import ml5 library](/?id=try-ml5js-locally-1).

## Import Ml5.js Library

### Try Ml5.js Online

Open the **Sketch Files** folder by clicking the arrow **'>'** at the top left corner of the p5.js editor. 

<center>
    <img style="display:block; max-height:30rem" alt="pose detection" src="_media/getting_started__sketch-folder.png">
</center>

In the **index.html** file, copy and paste the following CDN link under **&lt;head&gt;** tag.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5@latest/dist/ml5.min.js"></script>
```

<center>
    <img style="display:block; max-height:40rem" alt="pose detection" src="_media/getting_started__import-lib.png">
</center>

To check if the ml5.js library has been imported successfully, switch back to **sketch.js**.

Include this line of code: ```console.log('ml5 version:', ml5.version);``` at the beginning of the script.

```html
console.log('ml5 version:', ml5.version);

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```

If everything loaded properly you should see the latest ml5 version ```ml5 version: {latest_ml5_version}``` in the console.

Now, we are ready to write our first ml5.js sketch! Find [the next step to write your first sketch](/?id=your-first-sketch)!

## Your First Sketch
Now, no matter you are trying ml5.js online or locally, open your **sketch.js**.

We can start to build your first ml5.js sketch - a classic application of machine learning: **image classification**. This application showcases how you can use a [pre-trained](https://youtu.be/yNkAuWz5lnY?si=0JuaPFYlxLFE0WSU) model called [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet) -- a machine learning model trained to recognize the content of certain images -- in ml5.js. The application aims to highlight a general pattern for how ml5.js projects are setup.

Inside your **sketch.js** file you can type out (or copy and paste) the following code. Notice in this example we have a reference to "images/bird.png". You'll replace this with the name of your image.

```js
// Initialize the Image Classifier method with MobileNet. A callback needs to be passed.
let classifier;

// A variable to hold the image we want to classify
let img;

// Variables for displaying the results on the canvas
let label = "";
let confidence = "";

function preload() {
  classifier = ml5.imageClassifier("MobileNet");
  img = loadImage("images/bird.jpg");
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  classifier.classify(img, gotResult);
  image(img, 0, 0, width, height);
}

// A function to run when we get any errors and the results
function gotResult(results) {
  // The results are in an array ordered by confidence, print in console
  console.log(results);

  // Display the results on the canvas
  fill(255);
  stroke(0);
  textSize(18);
  label = "Label: " + results[0].label;
  confidence = "Confidence: " + nf(results[0].confidence, 0, 2);
  text(label, 10, 360);
  text(confidence, 10, 380);
}
```

*<img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__bulb.png" alt="tip icon" aria-hidden="true"> If you are not familiar with terms like **pre-trained model**, **MobileNet**, **classification**, **classifier**, **confidence** and would like to learn more about them, check out our [Ml5 Glossary](/learning/ml5_glossary) for a quick intro.*

## Our sketch.js explained in 4 steps {docsify-ignore}

### Step 1: Define your variables

Here we define our variables that we will assign our classifier, image, label, and confidence to.

```js
// Initialize the Image Classifier method with MobileNet. A callback needs to be passed.
let classifier;

// A variable to hold the image we want to classify
let img;

// Variables for displaying the results on the canvas
let label = "";
let confidence = "";
```

*<img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__bulb.png" alt="tip icon" aria-hidden="true"> If you are not familiar with term **callback**, check out our [Ml5 Glossary](/learning/ml5_glossary) for more information.*

### Step 2: Load your imageClassifier and image

Use p5's **preload()** function to load our imageClassifier model and our bird image before running the rest of our code. Since machine learning models can be large, it can take time to load. We use **preload()** in this case to make sure our imageClassifier and image are ready to go before we can apply the image classification in the next step.

```js
function preload() {
  classifier = ml5.imageClassifier('MobileNet');
  img = loadImage('images/bird.png');
}
```

*<img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__bulb.png" alt="tip icon" aria-hidden="true"> If you are not familiar with term **preload function**, check out our [Ml5 Glossary](/learning/ml5_glossary) for more information.*

### Step 3: Setup, classify, and display

In p5.js we use the **setup()** function for everything in our program that just runs once. In our program, we use the **setup()** function to:
1. create a canvas to render our image
2. call .classify() on our classifier to classify our image
3. render the image to the canvas

You will notice that the **.classify()** function takes two parameters: 1. the image you want to classify, and 2. a callback function called **gotResult**. Let's look at what **gotResult** does.

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  classifier.classify(img, gotResult);
  image(img, 0, 0);
}
```

### Step 4: Define the gotResult() callback function

The **gotResult()** function takes one parameters: results. This parameter gets passed along to **gotResult()** when the **.classify()** function finishes classifying the image. If our classifier manages to recognize the content of the image, then a **result** will be returned.

<br/>

In the case of our program, we are interested in the top 1 result which has the highest confidence and stored in **results[0]**. We store the label and confidence of the result in the variables **label** and **confidence** respectively, and then display the label and confidence of the result on the canvas with the **text()** function. The **[nf()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/nf)** function is a p5 function that formats our number to a nicer string.

```js
// A function to run when we get any errors and the results
function gotResult(results) {
  // The results are in an array ordered by confidence, print in console
  console.log(results);

  // Display the results on the canvas
  fill(255);
  stroke(0);
  textSize(18);
  label = "Label: " + results[0].label;
  confidence = "Confidence: " + nf(results[0].confidence, 0, 2);
  text(label, 10, 360);
  text(confidence, 10, 380);
}
```

*<img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__bulb.png" alt="tip icon" aria-hidden="true"> If you are not familiar with terms like **label**, **confidence**, check out our [Ml5 Glossary](/learning/ml5_glossary) for more information.*

### Try Ml5.js Locally
To run the sketch locally, we need to start a local development server.

*<img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__bulb.png" alt="tip icon" aria-hidden="true"> If you are not familiar with term **local development server**, check out our [Ml5 Glossary](/learning/ml5_glossary) for more information.*

#### Step 1. Open your terminal

```sh
# change directories to your project root directory
cd my-first-ml5-project

# install the dependencies
npm install

# run the local web server
npm run develop
```

*<img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__bulb.png" alt="tip icon" aria-hidden="true"> If you are not familiar with terms like **terminal**, **dependencies**, check out our [Ml5 Glossary](/learning/ml5_glossary) for more information.*

#### Step 2. You should be able to run the sketch at: 
```
http://localhost:8081
```

## And voilà! {docsify-ignore}

You've just made a simple machine learning powered program that:
1. takes an image,
2. classifies the content of that image, and
3. displays the results all in your web browser!

Not all of our examples are structured exactly like this, but this provides a taste into how ml5.js is trying to make machine learning more approachable. Try using different images and seeing what kinds of things get returned.

<br/>

*<img style="max-height:1rem" src="_media/getting_started__bulb.png" alt="tip icon" aria-hidden="true"> Some guiding questions you might start to think about are:*

*1. When classifying an image with MobileNet, does the computer see people? If not, why do you think that is?*
*2. Do you notice that MobileNet is better at classifying some animals over others? Why do you think that is?*
