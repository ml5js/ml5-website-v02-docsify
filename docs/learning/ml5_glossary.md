### Callback
ml5.js is heavily inspired by the syntax, patterns and style of the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. However, there are several differences in how asynchronous operations are handled by ml5.js. ml5.js supports both <b>error-first callbacks</b> and Promises in all methods.

In [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [callbacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function) are passed as arguments to functions that often perform some asynchronous operation. For example, [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) defines the [**loadJSON()**](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadJSON) function as the following:

```js
loadJSON('http//example.com/data.json', (results) => {
  // Do something with the results
});
```

Notice that the results from the callback in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) are given as the only argument to the function. There is no error argument in the callback.

ml5.js, on the other hand, uses a pattern referred to as an <b>error-first callback</b>:

> With this pattern, a callback function is passed to the method as an argument. When the operation either completes or an error is raised, the callback function is called with the Error object (if any) passed as the first argument. If no error was raised, the first argument will be passed as null. [Taken from the Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_error_first_callbacks)

For example if you are using the **imageClassifier()** method, you will need to construct it in the following way:

```js
// Pass a callback function to constructor
const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier('MobileNet', (err, model) => {
  console.log('Model Loaded!');
});

// Make a prediction with the selected image and pass a callback function with two arguments
classifier.predict(image, (err, results) => {
  // Check for errors. If no errors, then do something with the results
});
```

Error first callbacks is a convention common to many JavaScript libraries that we have chosen to adopt. The language JavaScript itself does not enforce this pattern. Keep in mind that most ml5.js methods and functions are asynchronous (machine learning models can take significant amounts of time to process inputs and generate outputs!). You will need to use the <b>error-first callback</b> pattern if you want to use callbacks.

### Confidence
Confidence is a measure of how certain a machine learning model is about its prediction. For example, a machine learning model that is 100% confident in its prediction is certain that its prediction is correct. A machine learning model that is 0% confident in its prediction is certain that its prediction is incorrect. In ml5.js, confidence is often used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model.

### Classifier
A classifier is a machine learning model that is used to classify data. For example, a classifier could be used to classify images of cats and dogs.

---
### Classification
Classification is the process of assigning a label to a piece of data. For example, a machine learning model could be used to classify images of cats and dogs.

#### **D**

---
### Dataset
A dataset is a collection of data. Datasets are often used to train machine learning models. For example, a dataset of images of cats and dogs could be used to train a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. In ml5.js, datasets are often used to train custom machine learning models.

---
### Div
A div is an HTML element that is used to define a section of a webpage. In ml5.js, divs are often used to display the output of a machine learning model.

---
### Dependencies
Dependencies are libraries that are required by another library.

#### **E**

#### **F**

### Feature
A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. For example, a feature of a cat could be its weight, or the color of its fur. Here, we have three samples of data, each with two features (weight and color of the fur) and a label (cat or dog).

| Sample # | Weight | Color of the fur | Label |
|----------|--------|------------------|-------|
| sample 1 | 5.8kg  | white            | Cat   |
| sample 2 | 36kg   | golden           | Dog   |
| sample 3 | 3.2kg  | black            | Cat   |

In machine learning, features are used to represent the phenomenon being observed in a way that a machine learning algorithm can understand. For example, a cat could be represented by a feature vector of its weight and the color of its fur. Color could be represented as a number, such as 0 for white, 1 for black, and 2 for golden.

| Sample # | Feature Vector | Label |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| sample 1 | (5.8, 0)       | Cat   |
| sample 2 | (36, 2)        | Dog   |
| sample 3 | (3.2, 1)       | Cat   |

In ml5.js, features are often used to represent the input to a machine learning model. For instance, the example given by the [Neural Networks](/reference/neural-network) uses the following data to train the model to predict the color of an object:

```js
// Step 1: load data or create some data 
const data = [
  {r:255, g:0, b:0, color:'red-ish'},
  {r:254, g:0, b:0, color:'red-ish'},
  {r:253, g:0, b:0, color:'red-ish'},
  {r:0, g:255, b:0, color:'green-ish'},
  {r:0, g:254, b:0, color:'green-ish'},
  {r:0, g:253, b:0, color:'green-ish'},
  {r:0, g:0, b:255, color:'blue-ish'},
  {r:0, g:0, b:254, color:'blue-ish'},
  {r:0, g:0, b:253, color:'blue-ish'}
];

...

// Step 4: add data to the neural network
data.forEach(item => {
  const inputs = {
    r: item.r, 
    g: item.g, 
    b: item.b
  };
  const output = {
    color: item.color
  };

  nn.addData(inputs, output);
});

...
```

Here, the example uses the values of red, green, and blue color channels as features.

| Sample # | Feature Vector | Label     |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| sample 1 | (255, 0, 0)    | red-ish   |
| sample 2 | (254, 0, 0)    | red-ish   |
| sample 3 | (253, 0, 0)    | red-ish   |
| sample 4 | (0, 255, 0)    | green-ish |
| sample 5 | (0, 254, 0)    | green-ish |
| sample 6 | (0, 253, 0)    | green-ish |
| sample 7 | (0, 0, 255)    | blue-ish  |
| sample 8 | (0, 0, 254)    | blue-ish  |
| sample 9 | (0, 0, 253)    | blue-ish  |

### Promises
ml5.js is heavily inspired by the syntax, patterns and style of the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. However, there are several differences in how asynchronous operations are handled by ml5.js. ml5.js supports both <b>error-first callbacks</b> and Promises in all methods.

ml5.js supports [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). If no callback is provided to any asynchronous function then a Promise is returned.

With Promises, the image classification example can be used in the following way:

```js
// No callback needs to be passed to use Promises.
ml5
  .imageClassifier('MobileNet')
  .then(classifier => classifier.predict(image))
  .then((results) => {
    // Do something with the results
  });
```

For some video tutorials about Promises, you can find this [Coding Train playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bKLPQvPRNNE65kBL62mVfx). There is also a [video tutorial about the ES6 arrow notation (**=>**)](https://youtu.be/mrYMzpbFz18).
