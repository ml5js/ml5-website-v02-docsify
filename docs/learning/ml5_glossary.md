# Ml5 Glossary

<br/>
Have you ever felt confused about a term we used here at ml5? No worries, we've got you covered! Check out this glossary. Here, we explain and define programming techniques and machine learning terms specific to ml5 that are mentioned in our libraries, website, and examples.

#### **A**

### Activation Function
An activation function is a function that determines the output of a neural network. An activation function is a function that determines the output of a neural network. Activation functions are often used to introduce non-linearity into a neural network. In ml5.js, activation functions are often used to introduce non-linearity into a neural network.

#### **B**

### Bias
A bias is a constant value that is added to the input of a neural network. A bias is a constant value that is added to the input of a neural network. Biases are often used to introduce non-linearity into a neural network. In ml5.js, biases are often used to introduce non-linearity into a neural network.

#### **C**

### Callback
ml5.js is heavily inspired by the syntax, patterns and style of the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. However, there are several differences in how asynchronous operations are handled by ml5.js. ml5.js supports both <b>error-first callbacks</b> and Promises in all methods.

In [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [callbacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function) are passed as arguments to functions that often perform some asynchronous operation. For example, [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) defines the [**loadJSON()**](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadJSON) function as the following:

```js
loadJSON('http//example.com/data.json', (results) => {
  // Do something with the results
});
```

Notice that the results from the callback in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) are given as the only argument to the function. There is no error argument in the callback.

ml5.js, on the other hand, uses a pattern referred to as an <b>error-first callback</b>:

> With this pattern, a callback function is passed to the method as an argument. When the operation either completes or an error is raised, the callback function is called with the Error object (if any) passed as the first argument. If no error was raised, the first argument will be passed as null. [Taken from the Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_error_first_callbacks)

For example if you are using the **imageClassifier()** method, you will need to construct it in the following way:

```js
// Pass a callback function to constructor
const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier('MobileNet', (err, model) => {
  console.log('Model Loaded!');
});

// Make a prediction with the selected image and pass a callback function with two arguments
classifier.predict(image, (err, results) => {
  // Check for errors. If no errors, then do something with the results
});
```

Error first callbacks is a convention common to many JavaScript libraries that we have chosen to adopt. The language JavaScript itself does not enforce this pattern. Keep in mind that most ml5.js methods and functions are asynchronous (machine learning models can take significant amounts of time to process inputs and generate outputs!). You will need to use the <b>error-first callback</b> pattern if you want to use callbacks.

### Confidence
Confidence is a measure of how certain a machine learning model is about its prediction. For example, a machine learning model that is 100% confident in its prediction is certain that its prediction is correct. A machine learning model that is 0% confident in its prediction is certain that its prediction is incorrect. In ml5.js, confidence is often used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model.

### Feature
A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. Features are used to represent the phenomenon numerically. For example, a feature of a cat could be its weight, or the color of its fur. In machine learning, features are used to represent the phenomenon being observed in a way that a machine learning algorithm can understand. For example, a cat could be represented by a feature vector of its weight and the color of its fur. In ml5.js, features are often used to represent the input to a machine learning model.

#### **G**

### Labels

Overfitting can result in a machine learning model that performs well on the training data, but performs poorly on new data. In ml5.js, overfitting is often used to describe the performance of a machine learning model.

### Promises
ml5.js is heavily inspired by the syntax, patterns and style of the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. However, there are several differences in how asynchronous operations are handled by ml5.js. ml5.js supports both <b>error-first callbacks</b> and Promises in all methods.

ml5.js supports [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). If no callback is provided to any asynchronous function then a Promise is returned.

With Promises, the image classification example can be used in the following way:

```js
// No callback needs to be passed to use Promises.
ml5
  .imageClassifier('MobileNet')
  .then(classifier => classifier.predict(image))
  .then((results) => {
    // Do something with the results
  });
```
